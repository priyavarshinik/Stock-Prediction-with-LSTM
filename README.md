# Stock-Prediction-with-LSTM
Predicting stock market price with LSTM and exploring a few other regression models.

Stock market prices change every day, and predicting the prices is extremely difficult. This project will give a tour, starting with the stock market, a description of stock data, and how to forecast it.

Stock market prediction is the process of attempting to determine the future value of a stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. Predicting the movement of stock prices is complex due to the influence of numerous factors, including market sentiment, economic indicators, and company performance. This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network (RNN) type, to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

# Stock Market:
The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where publicly held companies' shares are bought, sold, and issued. These activities are conducted through formal exchanges (e.g., New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ) or over-the-counter (OTC) marketplaces. The stock market plays a crucial role in the economy by enabling companies to raise capital from the public and providing investors with opportunities to earn returns on their investments.

# Conditions for Time series data: 

The stock market is a time series data, so there are several important considerations to ensure that your analysis, modelling, and predictions are valid and meaningful. 

1. The sequence of data points in a time series is crucial. Shuffling or randomising the data can destroy the temporal structure, leading to misleading results. Time series data often exhibits autocorrelation, where past values influence future values.
2. A time series is stationary if its statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation, etc.) are constant over time. If your data is not stationary, you might need to apply transformations (like differencing, detrending, or log transformations) to make it stationary. You can use tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) or the KPSS test to check for stationarity.
3. If not accounted for, Long-term upward or downward movements in the data can affect model accuracy. Techniques like differencing can help remove trends.
4. Regular patterns that repeat over fixed periods (e.g., daily, weekly, yearly) need to be identified and modelled separately if they exist. Decomposing the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components can be helpful.
5. Instead of randomly splitting the data for training and testing, use time series-specific methods like time-based splits (e.g., time series split, walk-forward validation).
6. With complex and high-frequency data like stock prices, machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) or deep learning models (e.g., RNN, CNN) might be more appropriate, especially if capturing non-linear patterns.
7. Always evaluate your model on a separate test set representing future periods not seen during training. Use techniques like time series cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation.
8. Common metrics for time series forecasting include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and directional accuracy (critical for stock market predictions).

# Data

Date: The specific date of the trading day. This is used to organize and index the stock data chronologically.

Open: The stock's price at the beginning of the trading session. This price reflects what traders will pay for the stock at the market's opening bell.

Close: The stock's price at the end of the trading session. This price reflects what traders will pay for the stock as the market closes for the day. The closing price is often considered a key indicator of the stockâ€™s daily performance.

High: The highest price at which the stock was traded during trading. This value provides insight into the stock's peak performance for that day.

Low: The lowest price at which the stock was traded during trading. This value shows the minimum level of the stock's performance for that day.

Volume: The total number of shares of the stock that were traded during the day. This metric is important for understanding the market activity and liquidity of the stock on that particular day.

Adj Close (Adjusted Close): The stock's closing price after adjustments for all applicable splits and dividend distributions. The adjusted close price is essential for comparing historical prices because it accounts for corporate actions that affect the stock price.
